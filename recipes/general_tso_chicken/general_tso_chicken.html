    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in large mixing bowl. Add chicken, salt, sugar, and pepper; mix well. 
            Mix in cornstarch, a little bit at a time, until chicken is well coated.</li>

        <li>Working in batches, carefully drop one piece of chicken at a time into the hot oil. 
            Fry until chicken turns golden brown and begins to float, about 3 minutes. 
            Remove chicken to a plate and allow to cool as you fry the next batch.</li>

        <li>Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first. 
            Fry each batch until chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li> Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. 
            Stir in green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. 
            Cook and stir until garlic turns golden and chiles brighten, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes. 
            Whisk 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in water until dissolved. 
            Stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1 minute.</li>
