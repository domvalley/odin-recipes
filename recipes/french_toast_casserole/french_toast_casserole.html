    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Use brioche to make French toast casserole for a special treat.
        Brioche bread is very fluffy and rich, so it absorbs the milk and eggs very well but still keeps its distinct flavor.
        The cinnamon strusel on top falls into the crevices of the bread, making every bite sweet and crunchy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flower</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>16 ounce brioche loaf, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
